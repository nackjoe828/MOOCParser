While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don\'t. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere\'s how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I\'ll dig deeper.

Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers.

Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach  simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I\'m going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.','https://class.coursera.org/automata/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Tb_2HdsqypI/full/540p/index.webm','2012-04-23',6,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/large-icon.png','Computer Science: Theory','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Stanford University','2014-04-09 16:19:23'),(363,'Computer Security','Learn how to design secure systems and write secure code.

This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.','https://class.coursera.org/pgm-2012-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/bVMBe50GfnI/full/540p/index.webm','2012-09-24',11,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/pgm/large-icon.png','Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Stanford University','2014-04-09 16:19:28'),(368,'Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1','In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design: divide-and-conquer methods, graph algorithms, practical data structures (heaps, hash tables, search trees), randomized algorithms, and more.','In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design.

We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don\'t. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere\'s how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I\'ll dig deeper. I\'ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won\'t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I\'ll offer some questions and we\'ll have quizzes and even a final exam.

Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. <br><br> We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context.

Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box  a valuable ability in todays world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>\n<div><br>The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily atfirst-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two.

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that (a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics. This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.<br><br> <strong><br></strong>','https://class.coursera.org/neuroethics-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/-p3iFE06q14/full/540p/index.webm','2013-09-30',8,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/neuroethics/large-icon.png','Health & Society','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','University of Pennsylvania','2014-04-09 16:19:57'),(403,'Rationing and Allocating Scarce Medical Resources','This course will explore the complex challenges of allocating scarce medical resources at both the micro and macro level.

But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this\ntopic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of\n2014. Both the Coursera and the UVA students use the same online material as\na common foundation for their different learning experiences. This is the material to survey \'what\nhappened\' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes  some of\nthose questions that start with:\n\"Why?\" (The students in\nthe UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional\nreading; research projects on the histories of particular communities around\nthe world; in-person tutorials and discussions, both with the professor and with the graduate teaching assistants; and examinations.) </p><p><br></p>\n\n<p>It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the\nbig patterns, we don\'t have to get too caught up in the details. In this\ncourse, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some\ncareful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big\nchanges come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into\njust a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing\nafter another. So beyond just offering a set of remarkable stories, this course offers you training in how to\nanalyze a situation andhow to think about problems of explaining change.</p>','https://class.coursera.org/modernworld-2012-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/erG5s8o9iuc/full/540p/index.webm','2013-01-14',15,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/0daecfe0161d8305452f9650ea2eaf/Flag-Globe.png','Humanities ','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','University of Virginia','2014-04-09 16:20:52'),(469,'How Things Work 1','An introduction to physics in the context of everyday objects.','<div>Designed for non-science students, this course is a practical \nintroduction to physics and science in everyday life.

Every week, youll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.\nArmed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it  and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.<br><br>Join your future classmates and course alumni on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/\">Facebook</a>!<br>','https://class.coursera.org/organalysis-2012-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/cm8JD0Exbwc/full/540p/index.webm','2012-09-24',10,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/organalysis/large-icon.png','Business & Management Education Social Sciences','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Stanford University','2014-04-09 16:21:06'),(484,'Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital','In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.','What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.<br><br> The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video.

We expect a quick fix for almost any medical problem. We refer to ample amounts of medical information (or mis-information) online, sometimes without the guidance of a health professional. We are taking prescription and over-the-counter medications at unprecedented rates, and there are benefits to this phenomenon, including in many cases, improved disease treatment. Sadly, a darker consequence has also emerged: the epidemic rise of injuries and fatalities due to prescription drug abuse. <br><br>This course uses science to investigate the prevalence, dangers, and misperceptions regarding this growing health problem. Using a myth-busting design, we will investigate the biology behind both therapeutic and illicit drug action and tie that biology to the real dangers of abusing prescription drugs.

','With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br> <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br> <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br> <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br> <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>','https://class.coursera.org/musicproduction-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pgIQ7ouOw4M/full/540p/index.webm','2013-03-01',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fe/015ba2a0d465c31b47ac36670098ea/production-large.jpg','Music, Film, and Audio','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Berklee College of Music','2014-04-09 16:21:56'),(542,'Sports and Society','This course explores the role of sports around the world, and how the games we watch and play shape identity, culture, and society.

This course will\nexplore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art\nand as insights into ourselves and our world.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h2>Work Expectations</h2>\nFor further information about the coursework, please see the <a href=\"http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.html\"> Work Expectations</a> page.','https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/RIdztDwScAQ/full/540p/index.webm','2013-01-22',11,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/fantasysf/large-icon.png','Humanities ','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','University of Michigan','2014-04-09 16:22:18'),(562,'Introduction to Finance','This course will introduce you to frameworks and tools to measure value; both for corporate and personal assets.

Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration\n    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback.

The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.</div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining).</div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree <i>will</i> be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.</div><div><br></div><div>Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).</div><div><br></div><div>Topics covered:<br><br></div><ul><li>Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.</li><li>Mechanisms of molecular evolution.</li><li>Models of substitution.</li><li>Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.</li><li>Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).</li><li>Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics).</li></ul><div><br></div>','https://class.coursera.org/molevol-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/SCj2vAtYqho/full/540p/index.webm','2013-06-24',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/4477a07c5b11e398ffd13042f0adc4/darwin_logo2.jpg','Biology & Life Sciences Statistics and Data Analysis','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Technical University of Denmark (DTU)','2014-04-09 16:23:31'),(647,'Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics','Learn mathematical and statistical tools and techniques used in quantitative and computational finance.

What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that\n    terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?</p>\n<p>These are just a handful of questions that will be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the\n    difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since 9/11 terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come\n    up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either\n    stress their importance or to debunk them as myths.

It\nstarts a conversation with users and stakeholders inside and outside\nan organization. Conversations are the natural way people think about\ncomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop stories,\nwhich lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy\npractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises  in all departments\nand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.\n<br>\n<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that\nif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their\njob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier\n creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is\nvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their\nenterprise stand out.\n<br>\n<br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy\npractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile\nmedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,\nactionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic\ncontent they produce enhances the audiences lives anddeepens their\nunderstanding and engagement with the organization.\n<br>\n<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it\nis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,\ntrustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.\nOften it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional\njournalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not\nadvertising, marketing, or public relations.

The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere\'s how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I\'ll dig deeper. I\'ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won\'t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I\'ll offer some questions and we\'ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you\'ll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that\'s fine too. It\'s all free.

And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis! ','This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what\'s in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.<br><div>Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.</div>','https://class.coursera.org/analyticalchem-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/rWyUwM-GwgE/full/540p/index.webm','0000-00-00',8,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/analyticalchem/large-icon.png','Chemistry','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Rice University','2014-04-09 16:25:39'),(793,'Writing II: Rhetorical Composing','Rhetorical Composing engages you in a series of interactive reading, research, and composing activities along with assignments designed to help you become more effective consumers and producers of alphabetic, visual and multimodal texts.\n\nJoin us to become more effective writers... and better citizens.','<p>Rhetorical Composing is a course where writers exchange words, ideas,\n    talents, and support.

','<p></p><p>Teachers face a blizzard of decisions. Scholars estimate\nthat teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most of\nwhich are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are the\nmyriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing student\nwork, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, its\neasy for bad habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.<br></p>\n\n<p>The question then becomes: </p>\n\n<p><b><i>How in such a fast-paced environment can coaches\nand instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice that\nactually stick? </i></b></p>\n\n<p>Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable about\ninstruction; theyre also highly strategic in their approach to changing\nteachers behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical\nfeedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to\nensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. </p>\n\n<p><span>Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack of\ndirection, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to Do\nX, but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps for\nimplementation. Most commonly, coaches\ncan be overly suggestive, telling the teacher You <i>might</i> do X, Y, and Z,\nand <i>maybe</i> even A, B, and C, too. With an already very full plate, this\napproach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercutting\nthe likelihood of meaningful change. </span></p>\n\n<p>Even teacher coaching thats described as good can sometimes\nfall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say the\nright things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. But\nunless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the good in this case\ncould actually end up being the enemy of effective. </p>\n\n<p>Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches who\nprovide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Course\nparticipants will be introduced to Matchs Five key principles of effective\ncoaching, which strike the right balance between providing clear direction for\nteachers, while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals: </p>\n\n<p>1)\n<b>Permission-based\nCoaching</b></p>\n\n<p>Teachers first need to permit themselves to receive\ncoaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs to\nknow how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In this\nsession of the course, we focus on concrete strategies that help teachers\nreceive and process critical feedback, while maintaining a growth mindset\nabout their practice. </p>\n\n<p>2)\n<b>Shared\nVocabulary and Vision</b></p>\n\n<p>A teacher coaching relationship must begin with a shared\nvocabulary for talking about instruction, and a common vision for what\nexcellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course, we introduce a\nsimple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could use\nwith a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking for\nwhen s/he conducts classroom observations.</p>\n\n<p>3)\n<b>Selecting\nand Setting Measurable Goals </b></p>\n\n<p>Novice teachers, in particular, often describe the feedback\nthey receive from expert coaches as akin to drinking from a fire hose \ntheres so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritize\nnext steps for their practice. In this session of the course, we focus on how\nto analyze classroom instruction and select a single, measurable goal that\naddresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teachers practice. </p>\n\n<p>4)\n<b>Delivering\nDirective Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedback\nsession with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve their\ngoals. However, the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coach\nwho struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulate\nconcrete, actionable solutions. In this session, we introduce and practice a\nprotocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers have\nthe direction they need to successfully implement a coachs feedback. </p>\n\n<p>5)\n<b>Create\nOpportunities for Practice </b></p>\n\n<p>Great coaches dont just leave it to chance that a teacher\nis ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They first\ntry to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the action\nsteps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in the\nclassroom. In this session, we explore different exercises for practicing\naction steps within a coaching feedback session.</p><p></p><p><b>Course Learning Outcomes</b><br></p><p></p><p>o\nTo\ndescribe and analyze strategies that help a teacher develop a growth mindset\nabout accepting and acting on critical feedback.</p>\n\n<p>o\nTo\ndescribe and analyze tools (e.g. observation rubrics) that help teachers and\ncoaches develop a shared vocabulary and vision about excellent classroom\npractice. </p>\n\n<p>o\nTo\nderive clear and measurable improvement goals for teachers based on\nobservations of their practice. </p>\n\n<p>o\nTo\ndescribe and analyze protocols for delivering directive, actionable feedback to\nteachers. </p>\n\n<p>o\nTo\ndescribe and analyze exercises that generate meaningful opportunities to\npractice implementing feedback.</p><p></p>','https://class.coursera.org/coachingteachers-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/4dd53c00aa0711e3ab2b6d7a2dd0d533/full/540p/index.webm','2014-05-09',5,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/79/40743767350110b045f4ee6aa99dd7/coaching.jpg','Education Teacher Professional Development','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Match Teacher Residency','2014-04-09 16:26:19'),(838,'On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement','Take charge of your own improvement as a teacher by collecting and acting upon feedback.

So we should say straight up: <b>this\nis NOT a typical MOOC</b>. Participants in this MOOC wont improve their\nteaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also wont really take\nanything away from this MOOC if they do it a la carte: we believe they need\nto do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes\nin practice that we think are possible in a course like this. </span></p>\n\n<p>We\nall wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have\neasy access to great coaching  or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately thats\nnot the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to be\ncoached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers\ndeserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan\nthe lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, or\nbecome the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We\nwill review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking at\nwhere that feedback usually comes to teachers and how its processed.&nbsp; In\nmost schools, the teacher plays a passive role in thiswaiting until an\nevaluation comes to them.&nbsp; We believe the best teachers create the\nopposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs,\nand use it. &nbsp;They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to\nthem, they might wait a long, long time. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n2:&nbsp; Case Study: Peer Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We\nprofile teachers&nbsp;who\'ve&nbsp;asked their peers to give them critical\nfeedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or\nobservation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after\nthey got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher\nwrite? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps?\nWhat did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks\nlater? </p>\n\n<p>Participants\nin this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback\nfrom a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its\nimplementation.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system.

The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse. <br><br>Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective. Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.<br><br>Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps.

This course will\nexplore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art\nand as insights into ourselves and our world.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h2>Work Expectations</h2>\nFor further information about the coursework, please see the <a href=\"http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.html\"> Work Expectations</a> page.','https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-004/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/RIdztDwScAQ/full/540p/index.webm','2013-10-07',11,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/fantasysf/large-icon.png','Humanities ','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','University of Michigan','2014-04-09 16:26:49'),(872,'Introduction to Finance','This course will introduce you to frameworks and tools to measure value; both for corporate and personal assets.

We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don\'t. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere\'s how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I\'ll dig deeper. I\'ll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won\'t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I\'ll offer some questions and we\'ll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you\'ll receive a certificate of completion.

','With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br> <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br> <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br> <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br> <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>','https://class.coursera.org/musicproduction-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pgIQ7ouOw4M/full/540p/index.webm','2013-07-19',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fe/015ba2a0d465c31b47ac36670098ea/production-large.jpg','Music, Film, and Audio','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Berklee College of Music','2014-04-09 16:27:01'),(886,'Songwriting','Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosodythe matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message.

In order to study the behavior of such functions well need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. Well begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once weve answered these questions well devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of \nthese thats quite alright, but do look at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\" title=\"Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set</a> for example to see some \nbeautiful pictures).<br><br>When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation  a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Dont worry! Well help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.&nbsp; After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. Well explore these properties! <br><br>Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly well have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects well integrate over? Curves! Well study these as well, and well tie everything together via Cauchys beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Throughout this course we\'ll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won\'t be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures. <br>','https://class.coursera.org/complexanalysis-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/4UaEx5Nu4Hs/full/540p/index.webm','2013-10-21',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a2/a156dfe552fa42b9a2732eeea5784d/Slide1.jpg','Mathematics','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Wesleyan University','2014-04-09 16:27:04'),(890,'The Ancient Greeks','This is a survey of ancient Greek history from the Bronze Age to the death of Socrates in 399 BCE.

NOTE:  The first week of Part Two reviews Part One, so you can take Part Two even if you missed Part One.','This is Part Two of a two-part course; you can find Part One <a href=\"https://class.coursera.org/money-001/class\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The description below pertains to the course as a whole, both parts.<br><br>The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.<br><br>Three features of the new system are central.<br><br>Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse. <br><br>Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective. Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.<br><br>Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That\'s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.','https://class.coursera.org/money2-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/a_oAv3k-2LQ/full/540p/index.webm','2013-10-13',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3d/de10ec50f6957ff54c956ac60262a6/institute_pgm_1_600x340.jpg','','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Columbia University','2014-04-09 16:27:14'),(900,'Introduction to Astronomy','An introduction to astronomy through a broad survey of what we know about the universe and how we know it.','In this class, we will be studying, quite literally, everything in the universe. &nbsp;We will start with \"classical\" astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times. &nbsp;We will then embark on a journey,\nstarting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae. &nbsp;We will end with some discussion of what\nscientists know today about the universe as a whole. &nbsp;Along the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton\'s laws, through our understanding of light and matter,\nto Einstein\'s theory of relativity, and from Galileo\'s telescope to WMAP.','https://class.coursera.org/introastro-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/lOmXPQtQzC8/full/540p/index.webm','2013-12-02',15,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/introastro/large-icon.png','Physics','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Duke University','2014-04-09 16:27:14'),(901,'An Introduction to Marketing','This Wharton course will teach the fundamentals of marketing by getting to the root of customer decision making.

It deals\nwith the interconnections between peoples from all over the world. It is based\non the idea that it is necessary to cooperate internationally to respond to diseases,\ndisasters and conflicts which now threaten us all. Humanitarianism, in all its\nvarious forms, is one such response. In\nattempting to organise a humanitarian intervention, though, we are confronted\nby a wide range of problems. Most acute of these is the intense inequality\nwhich marks the contemporary world. Public health  its capacities, delivery\nstructures and finances  is profoundly different for the 1 billion people who\nlive in the worlds wealthier countries. Those elsewhere have much more limited\naccess to publicly funded or privately insured medicine. As a consequence,\nnon-governmental humanitarian organisations now deliver a large proportion of\nthe worlds health care.</p>This course introduces these issues by looking first at the\nvague, yet highly contested, notion a global health agenda. It then goes on to\nconsider how and why the worlds wealthier countries have sought to develop a\nresponse to the emergencies and crises that the vulnerabilities of others have\nproduced. Here, public pressure and the ethical imperative to bear witness when\nconfronted with such suffering are especially important. Finally, the course\nconsiders whether or not humanitarian assistance can be considered a right. It\nlooks at the emerging Responsibility to Protect agenda and the associated moral\ndilemmas around sovereignty, post-colonialism and duty-based ethics.\n\n<p>Within this context, the course explores these critical normative\nand logistical questions:</p>\n\n<ul><li> Is humanitarian\naid as a concept, as simple as the rich helping the poor?</li><li>Are these\ninterventions well-meaning and effective? </li><li> Should governments\nbe committing tax revenues  involuntarily given  to improve the health of\nothers far away?</li><li> Do those that can\nafford it have a responsibility to act in some way</li><li> What does receipt\nof aid mean for the recipient country, its leadership, its future, and its\nresponsibility?</li><li> Must people be\nhelped only according to need, regardless of what a regime might have done?</li><li> Must humanitarians\nremain neutral  silent perhaps  in the face of injustice in order to ensure\naccess?</li><li> Must the causes of\ninequality, suffering and violence be ignored in favour of access, action and\noutcome?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the 3 sessions below is built around a series of\ninterviews with 3 leading figures in the humanitarian world.

The \ndriving force of bioinformatics is the exponentially\n    growing amount of big data generated by high-throughput biological \ntechnologies such as next-generation sequencing. For instance, the \ngenomes of human and many animals and plants have now been sequenced. The \ntotal amount of DNA sequenced exceeds 2,000 trillion bases and doubles \nevery five months. These \"Big Data\" brought unprecedented opportunities for new discoveries,\n    new patterns, and new hypotheses. At the same time, the data is heterogeneous with low signal-to-noise ratio. Handling such big data requires advanced, efficient\n    and accurate computational methods and computer tools. <br><br>Bioinformatics is a powerful new technology for the efficient \nmanagement, search, and analysis of petabytes of biological data. It is \nalso a new top-down, genome-scale, system-oriented scientific \nmethodology that complements traditional experimental approaches in life\n sciences research. In this MOOC we will teach the important concepts and methods in \nbioinformatics. We will cover the underlying algorithms starting from \nsimple sequence alignment and sequence search, and move on to genome \nalignment, next-generation sequencing data analysis,\n    and molecular pathway identification. We will use software and \ndatabases that we had developed in our own labs to illustrate how to \ndevelop new bioinformatics technologies. We will also use real cases to \ndemonstrate how to apply bioinformatics approaches\n    in life sciences research. In addition, we will try to provide a \nhistorical perspective of why and how some of the ideas were developed, bringing to our class a few renowned scientists to tell us about their seminal works and perspectives.<br><br>This MOOC is based on the popular \"Methods in Bioinformatics\" course \nthat we created in 2006 and taught in every fall semester since at \nPeking University. The first run of this MOOC at Coursera in fall, 2013 had over 17,000 registered students from over 40 countries. We hope that this MOOC can help you acquire knowledge and skills in bioinformatics that can be valuable in your future study and research.<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><br> </p><p></p><p>MOOC</p><p>DNA20</p><p></p>\n\n20062013Coursera4017,000<br><br><br><br><br>','https://class.coursera.org/pkubioinfo-001/','full/540p/index.webm','2013-09-30',15,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1b/1d251828791421ee3a5ebbd0b826a5/600_3402.jpg','Computer Science: Theory Medicine Mathematics Biology & Life Sciences Computer Science: Software Eng','https://www.coursera.org',0,'zh-cn','no','Peking University','2014-04-09 16:29:13'),(1038,'Pensamiento Cientfico','Aprenderemos cmo podemos usar el pensamiento cientfico en la vida cotidiana para tomar mejores decisiones.','<div>El pensamiento cientfico es slo para cientficos?

','With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br> <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br> <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br> <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br> <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience.

Far too little has changed inside our educational institutions, in the US and internationally, to prepare us for the demands, problems, restrictions, obstacles, responsibilities, and possibilities of living in the world we inhabit outside of school.

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that (a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics. This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints.

They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.  The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do.

Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.<br><br> The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image.

We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video.

Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severely\nill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified?\n<br>\n<br><b>Effective altruism\n</b>\n<br>We all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is good\nto do, but not wrong if we dont. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others?\n<br>\n<br><b>Climate change</b> \n<br>On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some other\nprinciple of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions?\n<br>\n<br><b>Animals</b> \n<br>It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting on\nhuman beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: Do animals have rights? But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also be\nput in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stopsthat is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified.\n<br>\n<br><b>Environmental values</b> \n<br>It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isnt\neven alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection?\n<br>\n<br><b>Why act ethically?</b> Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissed\nas illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life.\n<br><br>\n<p>This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers. You will also be encouraged to question your own ethical beliefs, and in the process explore the extent to which reason\nand argument can play a role in everyday ethical decision-making.</p>','https://class.coursera.org/practicalethics-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/2-trKNgq_tM/full/540p/index.webm','2014-03-01',12,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/44bbffd8ba8acd2cbeed2f87262ef6/practicalethics-logo.png','Humanities ','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Princeton University','2014-04-09 16:30:01'),(1093,'Computer Networks','The Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day.

','One of the most interesting\nand important developments in social science since 1970 has been the\n\"discovery\" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great\ncommon law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the\nthousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems.

You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.','Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behavior in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people (so-called bad apples). However, numerous corporate scandals, such as Enron, Ford, or Siemens, have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a corrupt context. Good apples may become rotten in bad barrels. Regardless of their good intentions and strong values, individual actors might adapt to the unethical practices in their respective organizational context and, over time, lose the ability to see their wrongdoings. They become ethically blind. Such changes in peoples way of seeing the world and their value systems can occur inand throughvarious organizational contexts in business, civil society, and public administration. This course is not about apples but about barrels and barrel makers. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.<br><br>The goal of this course is to empower students to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It will draw from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course will also analyze some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.<br>','https://class.coursera.org/unethicaldecision-001/','full/540p/index.webm','0000-00-00',7,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/64/7fca1dd6a137cd9008017e4cd55bfa/Biz_ethics_Fotolia_49499572.png','Humanities  Business & Management Social Sciences','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','University of Lausanne','2014-04-09 16:30:21'),(1116,'Control of Mobile Robots','Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable, and collaborative ways using modern control theory.','This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is \"control theory\", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, &nbsp;(2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.<br><br>While the main focus of this course is theory, it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform.

The answer is definitely NO. This course explains basic aspects of bluff body aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with application to sports and building aerodynamics. It is intended for anyone with a strong interest in these topics. Key fields addressed are urban physics, wind engineering and sports engineering. ','Can\nthe present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be\nfurther improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in\nathletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This\ncourse provides the answer to these questions. It shows that\naerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex\nand that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused\nby the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same\ncounter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both\nsports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will\nhelp you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes\nand of modern building design. <br><br>In\n2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a\nTour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25\nkm, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the\nsubsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat\nthe former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic\nimprovements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,\nsurprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team\ntime trial has not yet been explored.<br><br><p>\nRecords\nin athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and\nthe long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International\nAssociation of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed\n2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail\nwinds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be\ndecisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum\naerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.</p>\n<p>\nNew\nand prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of\nthe world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy\nsystems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe\ncourse starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of\nfluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary\nlayers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and\nbuilding aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the\naerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and\ntricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given.

Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the\n    writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readers expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed?

Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These\n    skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration\n    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations.

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy us-them dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life.

The 21st\ncentury also opens up an ever-intensifying degree of social risks, relativity\nand uncertainty.</p><p> It is against this general background\nthat the existing model of law and judiciary in China has been subject to\ncross-cutting pressures. A better analysis, understanding and reflection of the\ngeneral social milieu thus becomes a matter of necessity should law-makers,\nlaw-enforcers, judges, prosecutors and lawyers seek better solutions in\npractice. An pragmatic adjustment of legal institutions to contemporary needs,\nbe it by means of learning from other countries or of the trial-and-error\nprocess of innovation, will not be possible unless we are equipped with better\nsocial knowledge and greater familiarity with the history of thoughts.</p><p> Needless to say, the Chinese society is a\nsuper-large-scale complex system, of which cross-cutting social networks play\nan ultimately important role of self-organisation. Here, individual or\ngroup-based ways of conduct and thinking are culturally distinctive, albeit\nwith consistent practical reason of universal implications  a basis upon which\nthere arise such comparative-law prototypes as of the constitution of social\nnorms, the design of legal institutions, judiciary practice, the awareness of\nrights, justice-related social psychology, and the mechanism of ordering. With\na law and society perspective, this module aims to put the Chinese social\nstructure and its function under microscopic observation through legal lens,\nwhile as its obverse, to interpret legal phenomena in the Chinese social\ncontext. In particular, daily routines, facts and concrete cases will be used\nto map the evolution of legal traditions, analyse the conditions for\nconstituting a rule-of-law order, and reveal the value implications on our\nnetworked and risk society of a new rule-of-law paradigm with principles\nembedded within rational actions.</p><p></p>','https://class.coursera.org/sjtula014-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/4XdF49_BoF4/full/540p/index.webm','2014-01-01',11,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fb/8af0434ae241845661cf17228c0fd2/____2.jpg','Law','https://www.coursera.org',0,'zh-cn','no','Shanghai Jiao Tong University','2014-04-09 16:30:54'),(1153,' Exploring Particle World','    \n\nThis course gives an brief introduction of the main content and the frontier of particle physics in popular language.

Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis\nshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented\nby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this\nview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and\naugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.\nThe term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and\nmeans and more complex summaries: the principal\ncomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.\nSimilarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between\ninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.</p>\n\n<span>The view of the data as a subject of\ncomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.\nTypically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the\ninvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a\nsolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with\nthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data\nset - what sense can be made out of it?  Is there any structure in the data\nset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a\ntravelers view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist\nsits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate\nthem into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on\ntheir way  here is the data analysis niche.\nA textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by\nSpringer-London in 2011: Core\nconcepts in data analysis is clean and devoid\nof any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity\nseldom seen in a text of this sophistication.

Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models\nto support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs.\nNortheast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches.\n<br>\n<br>A massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing\nstartups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they\'ve hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials\nand donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging.\n<br>\n<br>During this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of\nprograms and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined.\n<br><br>In addition to learning about Cleveland\'s attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.<br>\n<br>One of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we\'ve learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to\nbest grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions.\n<br>\n<br>Most MOOCs rebroadcast professors lectures, but this course will be different. Dont expect to see me standing in front of the camera, talking and lecturing every week.

Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster  destructive\nof both art and of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism.

The lectures are taught in both Mandarin Chinese and English with slides in English.\n','<i></i>\n\n<p>Welcome to \"Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods\" at Peking University!</p>Bioinformatics is an advanced \ninterdisciplinary field of life sciences and computer sciences, both of which had seen extraordinary development in the past three decades. The \ndriving force of bioinformatics is the exponentially\n    growing amount of big data generated by high-throughput biological \ntechnologies such as next-generation sequencing. For instance, the \ngenomes of human and many animals and plants have now been sequenced. The \ntotal amount of DNA sequenced exceeds 2,000 trillion bases and doubles \nevery five months. These \"Big Data\" brought unprecedented opportunities for new discoveries,\n    new patterns, and new hypotheses. At the same time, the data is heterogeneous with low signal-to-noise ratio. Handling such big data requires advanced, efficient\n    and accurate computational methods and computer tools. <br><br>Bioinformatics is a powerful new technology for the efficient \nmanagement, search, and analysis of petabytes of biological data. It is \nalso a new top-down, genome-scale, system-oriented scientific \nmethodology that complements traditional experimental approaches in life\n sciences research. In this MOOC we will teach the important concepts and methods in \nbioinformatics. We will cover the underlying algorithms starting from \nsimple sequence alignment and sequence search, and move on to genome \nalignment, next-generation sequencing data analysis,\n    and molecular pathway identification. We will use software and \ndatabases that we had developed in our own labs to illustrate how to \ndevelop new bioinformatics technologies. We will also use real cases to \ndemonstrate how to apply bioinformatics approaches\n    in life sciences research. In addition, we will try to provide a \nhistorical perspective of why and how some of the ideas were developed, bringing to our class a few renowned scientists to tell us about their seminal works and perspectives.<br><br>This MOOC is based on the popular \"Methods in Bioinformatics\" course \nthat we created in 2006 and taught in every fall semester since at \nPeking University. The first run of this MOOC at Coursera in fall, 2013 had over 17,000 registered students from over 40 countries. We hope that this MOOC can help you acquire knowledge and skills in bioinformatics that can be valuable in your future study and research.<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><br> </p><p></p><p>MOOC</p><p>DNA20</p><p></p>\n\n20062013Coursera4017,000<br><br><br><br><br>','https://class.coursera.org/pkubioinfo-002/','full/540p/index.webm','2014-03-17',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1b/1d251828791421ee3a5ebbd0b826a5/600_3402.jpg','Computer Science: Theory Medicine Mathematics Biology & Life Sciences Computer Science: Software Eng','https://www.coursera.org',0,'zh-cn','no','Peking University','2014-04-09 16:32:32'),(1260,'Introduction to Music Production','Learn about the music production processincluding recording, editing, and mixingand the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. ','With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br> <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br> <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br> <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br> <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>','https://class.coursera.org/musicproduction-004/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pgIQ7ouOw4M/full/540p/index.webm','2014-01-27',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fe/015ba2a0d465c31b47ac36670098ea/production-large.jpg','Music, Film, and Audio','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Berklee College of Music','2014-04-09 16:32:33'),(1261,'Introduction to Guitar','Grasp the essentials needed to begin playing acoustic or electric guitar.

','With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br> <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br> <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br> <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br> <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience.

We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardwares role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems. </p><p> </p><p>Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats.

We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardwares role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems. </p><p> </p><p>Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats.

In the past decade, machine learning has given us\n    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,\n    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning\n    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without\n    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress\n    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective\n    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting\n    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you\'ll learn about not only\n    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical\n    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new\n    problems. Finally, you\'ll learn about some of Silicon Valley\'s best practices\n    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>\n<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,\n    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning\n    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,\n    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality\n    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in\n    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning\n    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,\n    so that you\'ll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building\n    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),\n    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other\n    areas.</p>','https://class.coursera.org/ml-005/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/e0WKJLovaZg/full/540p/index.webm','2014-03-03',10,'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/large-icon.png','Statistics and Data Analysis Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Stanford University','2014-04-09 16:34:27'),(1385,'Introduction to Computational Arts: Audio','In this 6-week course well introduce the fundamentals of digital audio.

Drawing on the latest archeological research and a wide range of comparative texts, this course synthesizes fascinating recent research in biblical studies and presents a powerful new thesis: Facing catastrophic defeat, the biblical authors created a new form of communitywhat today we would call \"peoplehood.\" Their achievements bear directly on modern questions of politics, economics, and theology.','With its walls razed to ground by Babylons armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished citiesfrom Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not. But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past. The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope. <br><br>Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanitys greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom: the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life. <br><br>The objectives of the course are to show: <br>how biblical scholars work with archeological and comparative texts to study the Bible\'s formation;<br>how the Bible emerged from large-scale corporate crisis and rupture;<br>that in our present state of uncertainty and instability we have much to learn from the various strategies the biblical authors adopted to create an enduring people of the book;<br>that one doesnt have to believe in God or accept the historicity of the Bible in order to appreciate its profound political messages;<br>that the Bible offers modern societies a model for creating communities around a shared collection of texts, songs, and laws;<br>and that the Bible itself has a major role to play in our futures.<br>','https://class.coursera.org/biblefuture-001/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/e32ac2a09b3111e399af07d96dcd4195/full/540p/index.webm','2014-05-26',7,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2e/b9e71ca3f5551267e71f671b837ce5/wright-class.jpg','Humanities  Social Sciences','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Emory University','2014-04-09 16:34:45'),(1407,'The Art and Archaeology of Ancient Nubia','This course examines the development of the art and architecture of the cultures of ancient Nubia through what we have learned from archaeology and how that evidence has helped us create the picture we now have of the culture and history of the birth and development of art and civilization in the Nile Valley.

By confronting you with several current EU policy proposals, you will be able to have a say in the EU policymaking process. We want to empower you as a citizen and business operator to maximize your rights and opportunities in todays Europe.</p><p><b>Understanding Europe</b>is structured upon some basic yet critical questions about the EUs purpose and legitimacy : why does the EU exist? How does it work? What can it offer you? The course then analyzes the European public sphere by focusing on its main actors (the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice of the EU) and the role European citizens play in influencing Europe. We then move to the Unions powers (what can the EU do? How far can it go? Do Members States have some instruments to block EU action? Can EU citizens challenge EU action?) by discussing the limits to its action and describing some of its policies. The course then analyzes the role and opportunities citizens and all stakeholders may have in shaping EU policies through public consultation, the European Citizens Initiative and other forms of participatory democracy. In a further step, we will analyze what the EU is doing for you regardless of where you are based in the world. Finally, by taking stock of what you have learned in the previous weeks, we will look at what you can do for and in Europe.<br></p><p>Throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You can interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructors assumptions and hence shape the courses content.</p>','https://class.coursera.org/europe-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/b8jb3zN4-1k/full/540p/index.webm','2014-05-06',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/80c06522d0032950be7b5560b216fc/UnderstandingEurope-Illustration-600-340.jpg','Humanities  Business & Management Social Sciences Law','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','HEC Paris','2014-04-09 16:34:58');

It develops the fundamental concepts of derivatives and integrals of\nfunctions of several variables, and the basic tools for doing the relevant\ncalculations. The course is designed with a content-based approach, i. e. by\nsolving examples, as many as possible from real life situations.&nbsp;</p><p>The why and\nwhere of the topics are discussed, as much as the what and the how. The\nanswers to the latter are the definitions and proofs, while the answers to\nthe first two tell the reason for studying a topic, and the areas where such\nideas are used.</p>\n\n<p>The transfer of knowledge through an organized deductive process plays an\nimportant role in mathematics (Aristotelian approach). An interactive\ncommunication between the teacher and the student through posing questions and\nanswering them leads to an effective method (Socratian method). The design of this\ncourse will benefit from the latter whenever feasible.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we study derivatives and integrals? Because derivatives express\nchange, and integrals define the cumulative results of many inputs. Change and\ngrowth through time or space are two basic aspects of life. Change is expressed\nwith the difference between two situations, and the cumulative result of many\ninputs is an additive process. Thus basically, calculus is an extension of what\nwe all learn as early as first grade as addition and subtraction. Calculus\nenables us to define and calculate instantaneous changes and growth by\ncontinuously varying inputs. Instantaneity of the changes and variability of\nthe inputs are handled by infinitesimal quantities. The final results are\nobtained in the limit where the infinitesimal changes become zero. The limit is\nthe central concept of calculus.</p>\n\n<p>A function defines the relationship between the inputs, which are the\nindependent variables, and outputs which are the dependent variables. The ratio\nof the infinitesimal changes in the dependent variable to those of the\nindependent variable leads to the concept of the derivative. Similarly, the\ncumulative outputs of entities such as matter, energy, area, surface, volume,\netc. are calculated by the sum of the dependent variable weighted by the\nchanges in the independent variable. This operation leads to the concept of\nintegral. Just like in Grade One, where we observed that addition and\nsubtraction are the inverses of each other, so are integral and derivative. This\ncomplementarity between the derivative and integral is expressed by the two\nfundamental theorems of calculus. All this is studied in the Calculus of\nSingle Variable Functions.</p>\n\n<p>Why multivariables? Because real life problems involve several variables.\nOur environment is defined by three space variables and phenomena evolve in\nterms of a fourth which is time. People- made phenomena require many more\nvariables. The course offered here is built on the knowledge of calculus of\nsingle variable functions and extends the concepts and techniques to\nmultivariable functions. The concepts and techniques are, in most cases,\nnatural extensions and generalizations from those in single variable functions.\nHence, each topic will start the review of the fundamental concepts and\ncalculation techniques from the calculus of one variable functions. This review\nis an opportunity to supplement what a student missed in the earlier course on\nsingle variables, while advancing into relevant problems from real life that\ninvolve more than one variable.</p>\n\n<p>(Source: Attila Akar,\nCalculus of Multivariable Functions, Volume 2 of the set of Vol1: Calculus of\nSingle Variable Functions, Volume 3: Linear Algebra and Volume 4: Differential\nEquations.

S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change.  The course introduces you to practical S-ENT examples as well as the foundational literature.','<p>The domain of social change is no longer reserved for students of political sciences and development studies. Increasingly business students are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.</p>','https://class.coursera.org/socialentrepeneur-001/','full/540p/index.webm','0000-00-00',0,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/70/1ecb4a1eda3cb74eb7667465d28c20/banner3__1280x720px.png','Economics & Finance Business & Management','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Copenhagen Business School','2014-04-09 16:35:10'),(1429,'Advanced Competitive Strategy','In six brand new modules, you will learn necessary tools to examine complex competitive situations and find solutions for them.

','With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br> <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br> <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br> <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br> <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>','https://class.coursera.org/musicproduction-006/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pgIQ7ouOw4M/full/540p/index.webm','2014-04-28',6,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fe/015ba2a0d465c31b47ac36670098ea/production-large.jpg','Music, Film, and Audio','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','yes','Berklee College of Music','2014-04-09 16:35:19'),(1440,'Jazz Improvisation','Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.','While many people are fans of\njazz and understand that musicians are often making up the\nnotes they are playing during a performance, most peopleoften\nincluding musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvisingarent\nclear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen.

Why is a\nperpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can\nbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac\nNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of\nphysics, but it will never go out of style.\nIt remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and\nis constantly used by engineers and scientists.

The goals for this course are to provide definitions and context of patient safety concepts and terms using a systems approach. We will explore foundation-level content in the science of safety, patient safety culture, teamwork, patient-centered care, and leading change. Students will also be introduced to strategies for identifying and mitigating risks through the use of human factors science and quality improvement methods. They will learn about the importance of using data to guide their change efforts, and about the use of the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) as one model to engage care teamsand entire organizationsin the effort to reduce preventable harm to patients. While course content and examples will focus on the acute-care healthcare setting, specifically the hospital, learning will be relevant to other healthcare settings such as extended care, outpatient, and home care settings. The content of this course has been adapted from the intensive five-day Patient Safety Certificate Program offered by the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality as well as the Helene Fuld Fellows Program undergraduate course content from the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.<br><br>','https://class.coursera.org/healthcaresafety-002/','https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/SlloZ7HcxKM/full/540p/index.webm','2014-06-02',5,'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/63/107d40bf2f11e3b38099c5ad975bf7/Science-of-safety-in-healthcare_600x340B_1_.png','Medicine Health & Society','https://www.coursera.org',0,'en','no','Johns Hopkins University','2014-04-09 16:36:04'),(1489,'Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World','We understand the world  and our selves  through stories.
