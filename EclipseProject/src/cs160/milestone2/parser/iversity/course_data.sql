(65, 'Design Thinking', 'This course is tailored for everyone who is involved or interested in creating or managing successful innovation - you could be a student, a designer, a manager or an entrepreneur.', 'Welcome to the Macromedia University Design Thinking MOOC. The first Macromedia University MOOC Design Thinking is about understanding and implementing the methodology of Design Thinking. You will learn how Design Thinking uses creative, human centered techniques as a strategic approach to stimulate innovation. At MHMK, Macromedia University of Applied Sciences, we believe that human needs and experience should drive innovation – not technology. Being a school whose graduates will engage in designing the digital landscape surrounding us, we like to share our conviction of a good, decent and ethical way of creating tomorrows products and services. Sign up now! The four-week-MOOC starts 14 April 2014 and ends 12 May 2014. What to Expect The Macromedia MOOC Design Thinking links theoretical frames with practice. You will look into fundamentals like historical and theoretical aspects of design, design models and design systems. You will gain deeper insights into the Design Thinking methodology and the human-centered design approach. You will learn how to apply teamwork and communications skills, and you will hear about creativity methods and visualization tools in the context of strategic design. And last but not least, the Macromedia MOOC Design Thinking will teach you how to evaluate ideas and concepts and why an innovation attitude and intercultural communication competence is crucial for a successful implementation. Week by week we invite you to meet academics, professionals and students, who are using Design Thinking in the creative industries as well as in management in order to solve problems of great complexity. Each week is divided into three or four lectures/chapters. Each lecture is divided in several lessons/units, which are usually not longer than 5 mInutes. The lessons are made of video material, slides, additional reading material and tasks. Expect to view approx. 80 minutes of lectures per week which sums up to altogether 5 hours per week incl. self-study time. Course Structure: WEEK 1: • Design Thinking MOOC introduction (Prof. Oliver Szasz) • Design Today (Prof. Tanja Schmitt-Fumian) • Design Models and Design Theory (Prof. Juergen Faust) • Design as a Discipline (Silvio Barta) • Design Systems (Prof. Juergen Faust) WEEK 2: • Human Centered Design and Research Methods (Astrid Thomaser) • Experience Design (Prof. Oliver Szasz) • Design Thinking Process (Thomas Stegmann) • Problem Space Definition and Wicked Problems (Prof. Oliver T.

To us, managing creativity means drawing on various findings and multidiscliplinary methods, yet guiding them through standardized and verifiable management procedures. Besides Design and Art history, the background of our MOOC team therefore ranges from business, psychology and human resource to transmedia, visualization, narration, and journalism, for instance. We will thus be able to discuss Design Thinking from various perspectives. Learning Outcomes Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions:? 1. What is Design Thinking? Which benefits may I expect when implementing it as a management strategy? ?2. How can innovation be systematically triggered ?? How can I implement Design Thinking into my own projects? 3. Talking about the potential of Design Thinking – what kind of best practices are there ? ?4. What kind of team do I need to in order to initialize a Design Thinking process? Prior Knowledge No prior knowledge of Design Thinking is needed in order to attend the MOOC. ?Interest in creative techniques, innovation and management is welcome.?- You don''t know what human centered design, strategic design or participatory innovation culture is? - Great, you''ll learn it here.?- You are a business development specialist? - Great, we hope to inspire you.

Find out more information about MHMK, Macromedia University for Media and Communication: http://www.mhmk-international.org/university/facts.html The MHMK Master School Creating Innovation: In creative professions, the demand for management knowledge and management qualifications has risen sharply in recent years. The Master’s course in Media and Design is aimed primarily at designers who wish to apply a comprehensive understanding of design to tasks and processes. However, it is different points of view which broaden one’s perspective, creating the fertile soil for true innovation. Therefore applicants from a completely different background are welcome, be they engineers, natural scientists or creative people. During their studies the Master’s degree students learn to think about and analyse management and design together, they analyse, design and implement, in short, they foster innovations through “Design Thinking”. Design Thinking describes a method to create innovative solutions and solve complex problems. Basically, it is a systematic creative process. Key ingredients are optimism and empathy, experimentation and holistic thinking. Within the interdisciplinary team, Master’s degree students develop solutions to design problems, be they in relation to strategy design, service design or human-centred design. In the English-language Master in Media and Design, the following fields of study to choose from are available: Design Management, Media Design, Service Design, and Strategic Design. At the core of the teaching is the concept of "design thinking". In interdisciplinary teams, management and design are brought together to develop innovative solutions.

The gaming industry is already more powerful than other ways of entertainment like music or movies. An average young person will spend more than 10,000 hours gaming by the age of 21 - somewhat the time that it takes us to master any kind of skill- and yet, there''s a huge engagement crisis in many other areas. 70% of US full-time employees are not motivated by what they are doing, kids spend way more time engaged with video games than they do with books, the average attention span in 2012 was less than 10 seconds and it''s decreasing every year... It seems like only games are truly understanding how human motivation really works. But how is that possible? Why are we glued to games? Can we design that kind of gameful experiences in non-game contexts to make them more engaging? And the most important question: How to do so? Course Structure Week 1 (17/03/2014) Games. Game Design. Gamefulness. Gamification Week 2 (31/03/2014) Psychology and Gamification: Why are games and gamification so engaging?

We''ll especially focus on how to design gamified experiences in real life and students will be able to gain knowledge in areas such as: game design, psychology, management, or education. Our main goal will be to understand and master the principles of gamification to design experiences that make things more fun and engaging. Who is this course for? Do you want your team to perfom better? Are you looking for ways to fully engage happy customers? Do you want to see kids learning while playing? Or are you just looking forward to seeing a better world? Gamification can be used in many areas and almost any task can be fun and engaging so this course could be great for people like: teachers, educators, managers, C-level executives, health and fitness professionals, psychologists or researchers. So... Whether you ever asked yourself one of these questions or you just want to know how to make things more fun and engaging, this course is for you! Prior Knowledge This is a level 1 course and all you need to bring in the class is a playful attitude! Anyway, having some prior knowledge is always great, so if you already want to start this epic adventure, here are 3 ways you can do so: - If you want to start reading some books on it: http://www.epicwinblog.net/2013/05/best-gamification-books-where-to-start.html - If you’d rather learn by doing: http://www.epicwinblog.net/2013/10/the-35-gamification-mechanics-toolkit.html - And if you like none of them, well, there’s always a way. Go and start playing games! Assessments and Certification This MOOC will be based on creative assignments where we’ll try you to learn by doing and after successfully completing those assignments, students will receive their statement certificates of accomplishment if their overall score is higher than 7. Besides, everyone will receive an statement of participation. Workload This course will feature weekly videos and creative assignments so you’ll have to spend around 3-4 hours per week, and if you want to know more, we’ll provide you with reading references and plenty of insightful videos, blogs and resources. In addition, there will be live hangouts and local meetups so the workload is actually up to you. Live G+ Hangouts & Local Meetups We plan to do Live Hangouts with the best students of the week, and local meetups with the best communities of the course. Live Hangouts Every 2-3 weeks, we’ll ask all the students to discuss about some interesting topics and we''ll feature the most insightful ones on a weekly hangout. More information coming soon. Local Meetups We’ll foster local communities within the course and we’ll try to organise meetups with the biggest and most active ones from all over the world. To do so, we’ll select 3 organisers that voluntarily apply for that position in the forums and then try to coordinate a meetup with the teachers during the course or afterwards.

Natural disasters are happening more and more often due to climate change. We can’t do much to stop them, but as architects we can help with the recovery and to build shelters that would withstand them. The goal of this online course is to generate design ideas for resilient schools for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and other natural disasters. The participants in this course will design schools, which could be implemented by the Department of Education and Architecture for Humanity in the Philippines. We will engage with a team of architects, planners, engineers, and social workers. After the course, the projects and instructions will be placed on the open source platform Open Online Architecture (OOArch.org), so anyone can download and use them. An international jury will select the best projects, which will eventually be built. We’ll have weekly lectures and daily discussions on our forum. A team of professors, consultants, and teaching assistants led by Prof. Ivan Shumkov will guide and assist all students in their work.

(79, 'Public Privacy: Cyber Security and Human Rights', 'Wild, wild web: Is the Internet a lawless no man’s land? Based on the recent public debate on data protection and massive privacy infringements, this course will explore the connection between cyber security and human rights.', '“For the internet to remain global and open, it is imperative that countries, including those currently lacking capacity to adequately deal with security concerns, to adopt a growth- and freedom-oriented, participative, bottom-up perspective on security that has human rights at its core.” (Joint Governmental Statement at UN Human Rights Council in June 2013) Arguably, the internet poses severe challenges to state sovereignty and governmental legitimacy. Governments around the world find it increasingly difficult to control, regulate or monitor the massive flow of data within the cyber-world and uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms at the same time. Nevertheless, the world wide web is one of the main prerequisites for economic growth and democracy. It enables citizen participation , engagements and inter-action on all levels that can lead to social transformation and political change. Radical groups, democracy movements, development organizations and human rights NGOs all use the internet to further their goals. Since the former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, released a variety of confidential documents we all know of PRISM, TEMPORA and other programs and their massive privacy infringements. These programs were primarily designed to collect user data to increase the capability of intelligence services to protect societies from internal and external threats. But are those programs not undermining essential citizen freedoms and fundamental human rights? This course systematically examines the compliance between international human rights norms, standards and mechanism within legal and political frameworks and the growing cyber security regime. Debates about the loss of state sovereignty over cyber security, paired with the idea of internet freedom and users’ and citizens’ responsibility lead to the question, whether individual and state responsibility based on reciprocity and human rights compliance are reconcilable. Learning Outcomes Students taking this course will learn: • how human rights are used in the debate about Public Privacy • how individual, societal, political and governmental actors interact in this context • what cyber security in consistency with human rights is about. Using this information, students will practice assessing and analyzing cyber security issues based on international human rights norms, standards and regimes. Course Structure The first part of the course will provide an overview of the current state of international and regional human rights regimes and their efforts to protect freedom rights while also ensuring private security. The second part will then go into the evolution of human rights, their violations and protection mechanism in era of the internet. Chapter 1: An Introduction to Public Privacy, Cyber Space and Human Rights Chapter 2: Human Rights - Yours and the Rights of Others Chapter 3: Human Rights Cyber Regime Chapter 4: Governance in Cyber Space Chapter 5: Security & Surveillance in Cyber Space Chapter 6: E-Governance & E-Democracy Chapter 7: State Sovereignty vs. Public Privacy Chapter 8: Cyber Justice through Public Privacy & Wrap Up of the MOOC Course Course Format The course will be hosted online and will consist of lectures by the instructor, as well as guest lectures and exclusive interviews with respective stakeholders. Additional reading material, animations and images will support each learning objective. Students will be assessed through quizzes, peer-to-peer review and their participation in interactive discussion forums.

Learn by doing and transform your everyday life into 101 projects.', 'Design is foremost a language. A language shared, talked and discussed by designers all over the world. Things, people and places we all know about. To discover more about the Design 101 mindset, you can follow our course preparation on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It would be nice to receive your feedback! Design your own world. Are you ready? Design 101 is a journey into contemporary design in which you will transform yourself and your everyday life into 101 projects. For three months, you will develop basic design attitudes that will allow you to thrive in today’s world, while restoring your understanding of its mechanics. We live in a global community where the physical bits are slowly (and not so slowly) overlapped by social media. Design has become #design. Indeed, the use of new technologies has changed the teaching and, by the same token, the nature of the past; the past is being renewed. Herein lies the conceptual hinge of Design 101: a new way to learn a new design. To do so, we will collectively explore the tools of today (such as this MOOC platform) to step into a fantastic voyage through time and space, in which we are all absolute beginners. How? Design is everything. Design is objects, buildings, sports, games…our lives. Johan Cruyff, a very famous footballer and fantastic designer, once said: “I never practice tricks. I play very simply. That''s what it''s all about. Playing simple football is the hardest thing.” very simply Everyday, you will receive a special package from a different place along our journey. The package will introduce objects, characters and happenings that are intertwined with the narrative of the course. Each bundle will include 2 main elements: An animated postcard announcing the day’s brief. A letter exploring subjects in depth with the use of links, books, movies, music and more. on a weekly basis Each week, there is a new unit consisting of seven postcards/briefs outlining a few simple activities to trigger your imagination. From 15 minutes to one hour of work per day at the most. The quicker, the better! On Mondays, you get an overview of the week and a quiz to complete. Then, following our input, you start working. By Sunday, you will upload images of what you made during the week. You will refer, think and create a lot of different things. Not easy, but surely fun! Our special trip will end with a three-day festival: a special event in a special place to exhibit your work to the public and get to know your travel mates. forum: questions and answers Doubts, ideas, whatever comes to mind. It is a perfect place to get entangled into discussions and become a true actor within the community. In the design world, questions are much more interesting than answers. This is why the best questions asked in this forum will be redirected to a Design 101 e-book, to be printed at the end of the course. extra! extra! encyclopedia! If you are of the curious kind, we have a special page with all the people, places, things mentioned throughout the course. We could consider it our mini-encyclopedia. Once we have a shared vocabulary/language, things become meaningful. Conversations start up quickly and flow nicely. Like any other language, “design” is in constant change. Our mini-encyclopedia is a great foundation upon which to build your own collection of references. Dates The course will officially start on October 28, 2013 and end on February 5, 2014. However, the course will remain "open" until April 20, 2014 (to give you more time to complete the homework). Content of the course/journey: The various things to do (so-called “hands-on” activities) will be divided into 14 units, one per week. Intro: Acquaint yourself with the course’s dynamics. Myself: Represent one''s self. My diary: Learn about the design process by creating a very simple object. Kitchen Stories: Become an expert at something and develop basic social skills. Visiting You: Look back at what we have done so far. It’s alive: Design as a garden. Voyage into my room: Understand interior spaces, plans and measures. Making things: Get familiar with shapes, colors, materials. Plan a series. Christmas break: Lots of greetings + some more. Zoom out (the city): Observe the public space in a new way (and map it). Telling stories: Form doesn’t follow function. Form follows fiction. Dressing people: Understand what “custom-made” really means. Road to nowhere: Learn to become self-sufficient. Ready to show? Ready to exhibit? Learning objectives Design 101 will help you understand: How the world looks through the special lenses called "design". Who shares your visions and ideas (who could collaborate with you in the future). How a community works: its behavior and potential. What skills and attitudes you have: their merits and limitations. Prior knowledge No prior knowledge is required. If you have a lot of prior knowledge, it might make the learning process more difficult, but don’t worry, no one is perfect. As we said, if we talk about contemporary design, we are all "absolute beginners"! Questions or comments?

We traced the development of architecture since the 1990s by discussing some of the most important topics and influential architects of our time.', 'Our course will analyze major contemporary architectural ideas, ideologies, and projects in the context of both globalization and specific local contexts. We will trace the development of architecture since the early 90s by discussing the work of some of the most influential architects of our time. The critical reflection on contemporary topics will allow students to better understand the buildings and cities which we live in. When talking about the architectural protagonists of today, we will focus on their most recent work. Some references will be made to their earlier work, but the focus will be on how they adapt their thinking to current design tendencies. We will examine the evolution of their work and at the same time try to understand how they react to current challenges and opportunities in our profession and society.

Exercises and Assignments Students will do research and critical analysis of architecture. They will analyze and comment on the projects presented in each chapter of the course. They will also explore buildings in the cities where they live and visit, according to the concepts introduced in the course, by taking pictures and making videos. The work will be posted every week on the course forum and discussed with others. A selection of the best projects and posts will be featured in an exhibit after completing the course. What will you learn? The course will introduce participants to the contemporary architecture scene and allow them to position themselves into it. Students will acquire the essential skills for looking at, analyzing and understanding architecture. The final goal is to turn use architecture as a way to look at the places that we inhabit, an action for positive change, and a generator of a vision for making possible worlds. Our basic questions What are current trends in architecture? Who are the protagonists that shape our cities? What can architecture do to improve our living conditions? What are the most significant buildings of our time? How can we improve the quality of life in our cities? Who is this course for and what prior knowledge do you need? The course is both for the general public and for people with experience in architecture, so any person can take it. Basic knowledge of architecture is recommended but not necessary. If you are already a student of architecture, this would be a way to expand and further your studies in a global context. If you are already an architect you can learn about the recent developments of the profession and be inspired for your work. if you have general cultural curiosity about architecture, this course will introduce you to some basic concepts that would allow you to understand better the values and importance of architecture. How much will you have to work? Living in the world of architecture is a full-time job, but you’ll have to spend 2-3 hours per week with your computer and a few more exploring your city. The final assignment will take a few days to complete if you want to qualify for the exposition. Certification You will receive a certificate for the course after you complete all the assignments. If you include it in your CV, remember that the course is offered by "Open Online Academy, New York." Study groups and tours The course will feature guided virtual tours and study groups. Students will be encouraged to set up Meetups in their cities and universities to discuss the course content.

(82, 'Political Philosophy: An Introduction', 'Are you interested in politics? Do you feel the need to have a clearer understanding of it, beyond the conventional language of media and social networks? Well, this course might provide the help and the stimulus you are looking for.', 'This course is designed as a vocabulary of the main terms used by all of us when talking about local as well as world politics; terms which we often use without a proper awareness of their meanings and connections, a circumstance not exactly helpful to any attempt at understanding how politics really works, regardless of our wishful thinking or simplistic morality or easy cynicism. Course Structure Now, if we want to get deeper into the workings of politics - the only serious starting point for those who want to reform it - we must agree to begin with very abstract notions, that is with the general definitions of what politics, conflict, power (incl. force/violence), and what legitimate power mean (Part 1: What is Politics?). On these premises we will then explain the still main political institution, the state, and peer into the dynamics of war and peace that has dominated the relationships between the states (Part 2: How Does Politics Work?). Since with economic globalization, which has restricted the room for political action, things are getting much more complicated on the planet, and more challenging outside of it (man-made climate change starts in the atmosphere), classical notions have to be rethought. The very nature of the threats endangering our global commons does not leave the definition of politics (Part 3: World Politics and the Future). This course does not aim at communicating any ''message'' as to how politics ought to be, but it will obviously try to clarify the main concepts - freedom, equality, justice - we make use of while talking about values and principles in politics; this is what is called ''normative political philosophy'' and is regarded here as an important chapter of political philosophy, not the whole of it (Part 4: Ethics and Politics). Learning Outcomes At the end of the course you may have achieved a clearer and less confused awareness of the political vocabulary, thus gaining a more complex, more autonomous and more critical understanding of political processes. If you are a student of political science, law, sociology and economics you may get better tools for catching the overarching sense of processes that you do otherwise approach in a fragmented perspective. Workload My teaching method aims primarily at defining and discussing concepts, not at illustrating authors or providing historical narratives; needless to say, there will be enough reference to authors, books, events and processes, in particular with regard to the evolution of political modernity. For each of the twelve lectures of about 30-40'', which will be presented in shorter units, you may need three more hours of homework to do additional readings and - more importantly - to perform additional reflection. Course Format For most of the notions discussed in the course I will suggest readings consisting of both classical authors and recent literature. For each lecture I will reply to up to five requests of clarification or critical assessments (all this exclusively via the iversity platform). From time to time you will have the opportunity to test your acquisition of fresh knowledge by responding to multiple-choice-tests. At the end of the course you may want to take a final exam, whose format will be announced later. Letter-grading from 1 to 5 will be used. There will be unfortunately no textbook. The textbooks available in English are all, though in various ways, different from my approach and my contents. My slides will serve as a textbook in a nutshell. Prior Knowledge Due to my conceptual approach, to follow this course you do not need a prior knowledge of philosophy or political science, just the degree of general culture needed to pass the final high school exam, be it Abitur, maturità, baccalauréat or ??(gao kao).

(83, 'The Future Of Storytelling', 'Learn how to analyze, contextualize and create stories and narratives in current media: from understanding storytelling basics to discussing new online tools and formats, this course brings together a network of media researchers, creators, and students.', 'Are you interested in the mechanics of current fiction formats? Do you want to know how stories are told? Do you want to analyze, understand, contextualize and create stories and narratives? Then join our MOOC and share our passion for storytelling! What to Expect Together with a whole network of media researchers, creators and students we will: - learn storytelling basics such as antagonist/protagonist relationships, narrative/narrated time, ... - have a look at exciting current media projects - analyze how they are designed and executed based on aforementioned basics - and discuss how (and if) new online tools and formats change the way stories are told and perceived. The 8-chapter course starts on October 25th, 2013 and ends on December 20th, 2013. (Please review the updated FAQ below in case you have questions.) It offers weekly video material, lessons, interviews and tasks on the following topics (not necessarily in this order): - storytelling basics - serial formats (on the TV, web and beyond) - storytelling in role-playing games - interactive storytelling in video games - transmedia storytelling - alternate-reality gaming - augmented reality and location-based storytelling - the role of tools, interfaces and information architectures in current storytelling. Our first Storytelling-MOOC will focus on fictional formats. Inspire and Help Understand Our goal is to inspire and help understand. To broaden our horizon of what is and might be possible and what has already been attempted, and what has succeeded or even failed - and why. In several little tasks you''ll analyze and practice storytelling on your own and in teams. Why this MOOC is Interdisciplinary Based at the Design Department at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, this MOOC is not only interdisciplinary, but also includes guest lectures and project presentations by game designers, writers, transmedia producers, TV makers, executives and theorists from many different fields of study. We will thus be able to discuss content, structures and technologies from various perspectives. Learning Outcomes Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions: 1. How do fictional stories work? Which structures and mechanics are used? 2. How do new technologies influence the ways stories are told and perceived - and which new media formats have been developed during the last years? 3. How can technologies, interfaces and visuals engage an audience fast and continuously? 4. How can I develop and implement my own story-ideas - on my own or in teams? Prior Knowledge No prior knowledge of storytelling mechanics is needed, but can be helpful. Interest in creative processes and new technologies is welcome and encouraged. - You don''t know what an alternate-reality game, RPG or transmedia storytelling is? - Great, you''ll learn it here. - You are a storytelling professional? - Great, we hope to inspire you.

Our MOOC is free of charge for anyone interested worldwide. However, how much of your free time you invest is up to you. When did this course start? This MOOC started on October 25th, 2013 and ran for eight weeks until December 20th, 2013. All video material will be available for another year for those enrolled prior to the course closing date on December 20th, however, the StoryMOOC team will not be consistently present on the discussions boards after December 20th. Can I still enroll? No, unfortunately enrollments were only possible until December 20th. All content will be available here for those enrolled for at least 1 year. Is there any other chance to get to the content of this course? Yes, all video lectures and interviews are to be uploaded on our YouTube-Channel http://www.youtube.com/user/officialStoryMOOC for those who couldn''t follow the course on iversity in time. Will there be certificates? YES! Statements of Participation will be available from Friday, Feb 21st onwards for any participant who has completed the course by 80% or more. This means: - if you already gathered more than 80%: Congratulations! In this case you have earned your Statement of Participation for the MOOC already, and can download it on Friday (or later) from the iversity course website (once logged in). - if you have not finished the course yet: Don’t worry, you still have time to go through all the videos, quizzes,... thoroughly until at least December 2014, and download your Statement of Participation once you’re done. What does MOOC stand for? It means "Massive Open Online Course". What does this course consist of? The course is based on recorded video lectures, quizzes and creative tasks that will be online from October 25th here on our course website on http://iversity.org/courses/the-future-of-storytelling. From October 25th onwards, a new video lecture will be launched every Friday for 8 weeks at 10am CET. If you''re enrolled this means: you''ll be able to access the videos from then on for at least the 8 following weeks, not just at 10am. How much time will I need to participate? From just watching the video lessons (about 20-60 min per week) to engaging in discussions and tasks (about 2-4 hours per week), exploring our reading list and even presenting your own current projects via essays or video link on our Facebook page, your involvement is entirely up to you. The more you engage yourself, the more you gain. Will there be graded assignments? There is weekly homework (Creative Tasks) that you are very well invited but not obliged to do to complete this course. There will be no graded/peer-graded assessments/exams. Our aim is to inspire, give input and offer a stage to discuss and work together with many others who share the passion for storytelling. So: What you make out of it, how much you get involved, is up to you. Is this course only available in English? Yes, for now. Due to technical and production time restrictions, we will only be able to offer this first MOOC in ONE language. As English is the language most applying students here share, we decided to go for it. However, we uploaded our videos on our YouTube channel http://www.youtube.com/user/officialStoryMOOC, were they can be subtitled using AMARA. My written English is not that good. Can I still participate in the tasks? Of course! Although language is an important part of storytelling in general, great works have been created without even a single audible word (e.g. silent movies). We are working on making our tasks as language-independent as possible. Good grammar and spelling skills are not the only key to succeeding in this course. How much time do I have to complete the tasks? Most tasks are designed to help you experiment with storytelling. They are useful for YOU whenever you do them. To make them count for the course, however, tasks given usually can be worked on for a week and they are due the following Friday, again 10am CET. How can I connect with other students? You can visit our Facebook-Page https://www.facebook.com/TheFutureOfStorytellingMooc (no FB-account necessary to read and see all posts) and/or use #storymooc at Twitter to connect with other StoryMOOCers. Also: Feel free to create your own meeting spots/blogs (that you are most comfortable with) if you want. Will there be a second edition/run of this course? Not for now. Although we would love to create and host a so-to-speak "2nd season" of this MOOC, there are no definite plans yet. This experience will therefore be unique for now. What do I do if I have questions that are not answered here? If you have technical questions concerning the iversity-platform/enrollments, please have a look at the FAQ. If you have any more questions concerning the content of our course or great ideas you want to share: You can always post on our Facebook-Page and ask the community in case our team is not available.

(85, 'Mathe-MOOC: Mathematisch denken!', 'Methodisch ausgefeilter Doppel-MOOC mit Geometrie und Arithmetik. Du möchtest mathematisch denken lernen? Sei Kiebitz, Anpacker oder Formalisierer: Du hast die Wahl!', 'Mathematik: das ist Freude am Denken! Und mathematisch denken kann jeder! Das bedeutet nämlich: Die eigene Vorstellungskraft entwickeln. Lösungen oder Lösungsideen sehen. Mit Vorstellungsobjekten gedanklich handeln. Abstrakte Strukturen visualisieren. Sachverhalte mathematisch präzise beschreiben. Sich vergewissern, dass eine Behauptung stimmt. Systematisch vorgehen. Im Prinzip kann hier jede/r ein paar Schritte damit weiterkommen. In diesem Kurs wird deutlich, dass Mathematik eine Philosophie des Denkens ist. Wer an diesem Kurs teilnimmt, erhält seine regelmäßige Dosis an meditativen Denkaufgaben, spannenden Knobeleien und mathematischen Einsichten. Die mathematischen Denkweisen erarbeiten wir uns gemeinsam in zwei Inhaltsgebieten: Arithmetik und Geometrie. Zahl und Operation, Raum und Form: Das sind die Umgebungen, in denen wir uns tummeln werden. Wir werden geometrische Figuren analysieren und mit Zahlen jonglieren. Satz des Pythagoras, Satz des Euklid: Wir werden mathematische Gesetzmäßgikeiten gemeinsam finden und beweisen. Anschaulich und formal. Mathematik wird oft missverstanden als das Anwenden von Verfahren und das Auswendiglernen von Formeln. Das ist nicht Mathematik! Wie man Mathematik wirklich treibt, wie Mathematikerinnen und Mathematiker denken: das lernt man in diesem Kurs. Wir erforschen mathematische Sachverhalte und systematisieren diese, wir definieren Begriffe, wir stellen Vermutungen auf und beweisen diese, und wir verwenden unterschiedliche Darstellungen, um über mathematische Erkenntnisse zu sprechen. Am 14. April geht es los - melde dich an! Überblick über das Kursprogramm: Im ersten Kursblock werden wir uns mit folgenden Fragen befassen: Wie definiert man mathematische Begriffe? Wie findet man eigentlich mathematische Gesetzmäßigkeiten? Und wie beweist man diese? Welche Rolle spielen Annahmen in der Mathematik? Wie baut sich das Gebäude der Mathematik aus Definitionen, Annahmen und Gesetzmäßgikeiten auf? Fragen über Fragen, denen wir uns mit zahlreichen Experimenten widmen. Im zweiten Kursblock werden wir die Denk- und Arbeitsweisen aus dem ersten Block in verschiedenen Gebieten anwenden und dadurch festigen. In der Geometrie werden wir uns mit der Tätigkeit des Messens und dem Abstandsbegriff, mit Strecken, Halbgeraden und Geraden, mit Ebenen und Halbenenen und mit Winkeln befassen. In der Arithmetik schauen wir uns den Begriff der Teilbarkeit näher an, veranschaulichen Begriffe wie "größter gemeinsamer Teiler" und "kleinstes gemeinsames Vielfaches", untersuchen Primzahlen und Primfaktorzerlegungen und experimentieren mit Stellenwertsystemen. Im dritten Kursblock befassen wir uns mit grundlegenden mathematischen Konzepten: Was sind Mengen, Relationen und Funktionen? Auch hier werden wir uns den Begriffen und ihren Zusammenhängen mit grundlegenden mathematischen Denk- und Arbeitsweisen nähern. Experimentieren, erforschen, untersuchen, ergründen, Vermutungen anstellen, Vermutungen verwerfen, Vermutungen beweisen. Im vierten und letzten Kursblock machen wir uns noch einmal an zentrale Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Mathematik. Wie findet man solche Gesetzmäßgikeiten, und wie beweist man sie? In der Geometrie schauen wir uns schicke Sätze am Kreis an, in der Arithmetik nicht weniger schicke Sätze der Zahlentheorie. Mathematik pur, Mathematik anschaulich, Mathematik handgemacht. Empfohlene Vorkenntnisse: Jede/r kann mitmachen, der mathematische Vorkenntnisse aus dem Gymnasium mitbringt. Und wenn Du nicht auf dem Gymnasium warst, aber gerne mitmachen möchtest: Dann trau dich! Man sollte natürlich schon mal mit Geometrie und Algebra zu tun gehabt haben. Vieles wird dann wieder aufgefrischt, denn wir machen dann nicht auf dem Niveau der 12. oder 13. Klasse weiter, sondern bauen die Teilgebiete, in denen wir arbeiten, noch einmal grundlegend auf. Oberstufenwissen zu Analysis und Linearer Algebra ist nicht notwendig! Zielgruppen: Jeder an Mathematik interessierte Mensch kann mitmachen. Außerdem werden unsere Lehramtsstudierenden an der PH Heidelberg am MOOC teilnehmen. Der Kurs richtet sich also auch an alle Studierende des Lehramts Mathematik und an alle Mathelehrerinnen und Mathelehrer. Du unterrichtest Mathematik in der Grundschule und hast niemals Mathematik studiert? Dann bist Du hier richtig! Wir werden unser gesamtes didaktisches Know-How einsetzen. In dem Kurs kannst du also nicht nur mathematisch denken lernen, sondern auch "am eigenen Leib" erfahren, wie man Mathematik lernt und lehrt. Welcher Mitmach-Typ bist Du? Du kannst dich entscheiden, wie aktiv Du dich in den Kurs einbringen möchtest - je nach Interesse und Ehrgeiz! 1) Kiebitze wollen "nur mal gucken" oder mit dem mathematischen Denken erst einmal warm werden. Kiebitze schnuppern jede Woche in den Kurs, schauen sich eins, zwei Videos an und stöbern vielleicht einmal in den weiterführenden Bereichen. Hierdurch bekommen sie einen Einblick, was mathematisches Denken bedeutet, und sie erhalten Impulse, wo man Mathematik auch im Alltag findet und gebrauchen kann. Vielleicht bekommen sie dabei sogar Lust auf mehr! Aufwand: ca. 1-2 Stunden pro Woche 2) Anpacker legen Hand an und erforschen aktiv Mathematik, haben aber keine rechte Lust auf zu viele Formeln. Für Anpacker heißt es: Ärmel hochkrempeln! Im MOOC lernen sie, wie man mathematische Situationen systematisch erforscht, wie man anschauliche Begründungen für mathematische Gesetzmäßgikeiten finden kann, und sie erhalten einen Einblick darin, wie man Abstraktes konkretisiert (und umgekehrt). Sie entwickeln ihre Vorstellungskraft zur Lösung mathematischer Probleme weiter und lernen, Vermutungen anhand konkreter Modelle zu untersuchen. Aufwand: ca. 3-4 Stunden pro Woche 3) Formalisierer geben sich mit der Anschauung nicht zufrieden - sie wollen Formeln sehen! Formalisierer sind Anpacker, die zusätzlich auch noch das Spiel mit abstrakter Symbolsprache lieben. Sie lernen, formale Definitionen zu fassen und formale Beweise zu führen. Natürlich immer basierend auf tragfähigen Vorstellungen, die sie mit den Anpackern teilen! Aufwand: ca. 7-8 Stunden pro Woche Du möchtest ein Kiebitz in der Arithmetik sein, aber ein Anpacker in der Geometrie? Oder ein Formalisierer in der Arithmetik, aber ein Kiebitz in der Geometrie? Kein Problem - alles ist möglich! So kannst Du deinen individuellen Aufwand selbst wählen und dir diejenigen Inhalte zusammenstellen, die dich interessieren. Nicht schauen, sondern machen! - Das Kursformat: Das Grundkonzept des Kurses ist nicht "schauen", sondern "machen". Wir machen Mitmach-Mathematik. Daher gibt es nicht nur Videos, sondern jede Menge interaktive Materialien zum Erforschen von Mathematik, spannende Aufgaben, die einen packen und nicht mehr loslassen, und eine Vielzahl an Möglichkeiten, sich mit anderen Menschen über ihre mathematischen Erfahrungen auszutauschen. FAQ: Was um alles in der Welt ist ein MOOC? Ein MOOC ist ein "Massive Open Online Course", ein Online-Kurs mit einer sehr großen Teilnehmerzahl. Wir haben einen von zehn MOOC-Fellowships des Stifterverbandes in Kooperation mit iversity gewonnen und starten unseren Mathe-MOOC im Oktober diesen Jahres. Also ist der MOOC so etwas wie Online-Mathe-Nachhilfe? Nein, der MOOC ist keine Mathe-Nachhilfe, kein Mathe-Schnellkurs und kein Mathe-Repetitorium. Hier gibt es keine schnellen Rezepte. Wir machen Mathematik auf eine vielleicht ungewohnte und unerwarterte Art, mit der man Schritt für Schritt zu mehr mathematischem Verständnis kommt. Du wirst es erleben - lass dich überraschen! Gibt es irgendwo ein Beispiel? Wir haben ein Beispielkapitel erstellt, anhand dessen man sich schon einmal einen Eindruck verschaffen kann: The Secret of Pythagoras ist unter http://testkapitel.mathemooc.de abrufbar. Dort kannst du dich auch schon beteiligen, eigene Lösungsideen und Lösungen posten und uns Feedback geben! Ist die Teilnahme kostenlos? Die Teilnahme am Mathe-MOOC ist kostenlos und für jeden offen. In welchem Zeitraum findet der MOOC statt? Wir beginnen am 14. April 2014, und der MOOC wird bis Mitte Februar gehen. Jede Woche werden neue Kapitel zur Verfügung gestellt, mit denen du dich innerhalb der Woche (und darüber hinaus) beschäftigen kannst. Mit einer kleinen Weihnachtspause werden das insgesamt ca. 15 Wochen sein. Bekomme ich nach dem Kurs eine Bescheinigung für die erfolgreiche Teilnahme? Ja. Lernende, die den Kurs abschließen, bekommen eine Bescheinigung für die erfolgreiche Teilnahme, signiert von den beiden Dozenten. Unter welcher Lizenz stehen die Mathe-MOOC-Videos und Materialien? Alle Materialien stellen wir unter eine freie Lizenz: Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/de/ Welche Mittel brauche ich, um teilzunehmen? Eigentlich nur das Internet und einen Webbrowser, der auch Java kann. Falls Du dir nicht sicher bist, ob Du alle Voraussetzungen erfüllst: Mach trotzdem mit. Falls technische Probleme auftauchen, werden wir eine Möglichkeit bieten, sich Hilfe zu holen. Alles andere ist "nice-to-have", aber kein Muss: ein Drucker, um sich Arbeitsmaterialien ausdrucken zu können; Schere, Karton, Stifte und Kleber, um Mathematik zu basteln; ein digitaler Fotoapparat oder ein Smartphone, um Fotos zu machen und ins Internet zu stellen; ein Twitter-, Facebook- oder Google+-Account, um dich mit anderen Lernenden auch in diesen Umgebungen zu vernetzen.

Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, über das Discussion Tool anderen Teilnehmern des Kurses Fragen zu stellen und selbst Fragen zu beantworten. Die Lehrenden werden ausgewählte Fragen beantworten. Wie können sich Kursteilnehmer finden, die in geographischer Nähe wohnen? Dafür kann der Bereich "Marktplatz" im Discussion Tool der iversity Plattform genutzt werden. Welche Voraussetzungen sollten die Projektideen erfüllen, die im Changemaker-Kurs bearbeitet werden? Seht euch dazu die Ausschreibung zum YOOWEEDOO Ideenwettbewerb 2014 an: http://yooweedoo.org/ideenwettbewerb Können am MOOC ganze Teams mit einem Projekt teilnehmen? Das ist möglich. Alle Mitglieder des Teams sollten sich für den MOOC einschreiben. Kann am MOOC auch ein Einzelner teilnehmen, der sich einfach nur interessiert und nicht in einem Team arbeiten will? Das ist möglich. Die Einschreibung für den MOOC ist als Person, nicht als Team. Wir denken jedoch, dass die Planung eines Changeprojekts im Team viele Vorteile mit sich bringt. Was muss man machen, damit man für den MOOC ein Zertifikat oder eine Teilnahmebestätigung bekommt? Alle Teilnehmer, die den MOOC erfolgreich abschließen, bekommen ein Zertifikat der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel. Zur erfolgreichen Teilnahme müssen die folgenden Leistungen erbracht werden: 1. Ihr gebt ein Projektkonzept zum peer review ab. 2. Im Rahmen des peer review schreibt ihr Feedback auf die Projektkonzepte anderer Teilnehmer. 3. Ihr gebt ein 100 Sekunden Video mit eurem Projektpitch ab.

(92, 'Einführung in die Betriebswirtschaftslehre', 'Was sind die Bausteine erfolgreicher Unternehmen? Warum gibt es überhaupt Unternehmen? Und was sind die Prinzipien eines guten Managers?', 'Dieser Kurs gibt einen Überblick über grundlegende Modelle, Theorien und Prinzipien der Betriebswirtschaftslehre. Er basiert auf einer mehrfach ausgezeichneten Lehrveranstaltung an der RWTH Aachen und wurde bislang von über 10.000 Studenten erfolgreich in Aachen absolviert. Alle Teilnhemer dieses MOOCs können nach einer erfolgreichen Prüfung eine offizielle Bescheinigung der RWTH Aachen mit ECTS-Punkten bekommen. Ziel der Vorlesung ist, Ihnen eine genaue Vorstellung zu geben, was modernes betriebswirtschaftliches Denken ist, auf welche Grundlagen es sich stützt und was die zentralen Handlungsalternativen des Managements sind. Der Inhalt umfasst den kompletten Stoff einer klassischen Grundlagenveranstaltung, wie sie an vielen Universitäten und Hochschulen in Deutschland gelehrt wird. Der Kurs beginnt mit der Frage, warum es Unternehmen gibt und was der Kern unternehmerischer Wertschöpfung ist. Anschließend analysieren wir, welche Alternativen und Theorien es zur Organisation von Unternehmen gibt. Ein Schwerpunkt auf die neue Institutionenökonomie erlaubt dabei einen Einblick in eine der Ansätze, die das moderne Management sehr geprägt haben. Im folgenden Teil gehen wir auf Prinzipien der operativen und der strategischen Planung und Wettbewerbsstrategie ein. Anhand ausgewählter Konzepte lernen wir einige der bekanntesten Ansätze des Managements kennen. Die Vorlesung schließt mit einer kurzen Diskussion des strategischen Controllings.? Zu dieser Veranstaltung gibt es als optionales Angebot jedes Wintersemester an der RWTH Aachen eine offene Diskussionsveranstaltung mit aktuellen Beispielen, Fallstudien, kritischen Reflektionen und viel Interaktion zwischen den Beteiligten. Jeder Teilnehmer des MOOCs, dem dies örtlich möglich ist, ist herzlich eingeladen (im Wintersemester 2013/14 jeweils Dienstag, 18:15 - 19:45, im Audimax der RWTH (Großer Hörsaal), vom 15.10.13-05.02.14).

(93, 'Mathe-MOOC: Mathematisch denken!', 'Methodisch ausgefeilter Doppel-MOOC mit Geometrie und Arithmetik. Du möchtest mathematisch denken lernen? Sei Kiebitz, Anpacker oder Formalisierer: Du hast die Wahl!', 'Mathematik: das ist Freude am Denken! Und mathematisch denken kann jeder! Das bedeutet nämlich: Die eigene Vorstellungskraft entwickeln. Lösungen oder Lösungsideen sehen. Mit Vorstellungsobjekten gedanklich handeln. Abstrakte Strukturen visualisieren. Sachverhalte mathematisch präzise beschreiben. Sich vergewissern, dass eine Behauptung stimmt. Systematisch vorgehen. Im Prinzip kann hier jede/r ein paar Schritte damit weiterkommen. In diesem Kurs wird deutlich, dass Mathematik eine Philosophie des Denkens ist. Wer an diesem Kurs teilnimmt, erhält seine regelmäßige Dosis an meditativen Denkaufgaben, spannenden Knobeleien und mathematischen Einsichten. Die mathematischen Denkweisen erarbeiten wir uns gemeinsam in zwei Inhaltsgebieten: Arithmetik und Geometrie. Zahl und Operation, Raum und Form: Das sind die Umgebungen, in denen wir uns tummeln werden. Wir werden geometrische Figuren analysieren und mit Zahlen jonglieren. Satz des Pythagoras, Satz des Euklid: Wir werden mathematische Gesetzmäßgikeiten gemeinsam finden und beweisen. Anschaulich und formal. Mathematik wird oft missverstanden als das Anwenden von Verfahren und das Auswendiglernen von Formeln. Das ist nicht Mathematik! Wie man Mathematik wirklich treibt, wie Mathematikerinnen und Mathematiker denken: das lernt man in diesem Kurs. Wir erforschen mathematische Sachverhalte und systematisieren diese, wir definieren Begriffe, wir stellen Vermutungen auf und beweisen diese, und wir verwenden unterschiedliche Darstellungen, um über mathematische Erkenntnisse zu sprechen. Am 14. April geht es los - melde dich an! Überblick über das Kursprogramm: Im ersten Kursblock werden wir uns mit folgenden Fragen befassen: Wie definiert man mathematische Begriffe? Wie findet man eigentlich mathematische Gesetzmäßigkeiten? Und wie beweist man diese? Welche Rolle spielen Annahmen in der Mathematik? Wie baut sich das Gebäude der Mathematik aus Definitionen, Annahmen und Gesetzmäßgikeiten auf? Fragen über Fragen, denen wir uns mit zahlreichen Experimenten widmen. Im zweiten Kursblock werden wir die Denk- und Arbeitsweisen aus dem ersten Block in verschiedenen Gebieten anwenden und dadurch festigen. In der Geometrie werden wir uns mit der Tätigkeit des Messens und dem Abstandsbegriff, mit Strecken, Halbgeraden und Geraden, mit Ebenen und Halbenenen und mit Winkeln befassen. In der Arithmetik schauen wir uns den Begriff der Teilbarkeit näher an, veranschaulichen Begriffe wie "größter gemeinsamer Teiler" und "kleinstes gemeinsames Vielfaches", untersuchen Primzahlen und Primfaktorzerlegungen und experimentieren mit Stellenwertsystemen. Im dritten Kursblock befassen wir uns mit grundlegenden mathematischen Konzepten: Was sind Mengen, Relationen und Funktionen? Auch hier werden wir uns den Begriffen und ihren Zusammenhängen mit grundlegenden mathematischen Denk- und Arbeitsweisen nähern. Experimentieren, erforschen, untersuchen, ergründen, Vermutungen anstellen, Vermutungen verwerfen, Vermutungen beweisen. Im vierten und letzten Kursblock machen wir uns noch einmal an zentrale Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Mathematik. Wie findet man solche Gesetzmäßgikeiten, und wie beweist man sie? In der Geometrie schauen wir uns schicke Sätze am Kreis an, in der Arithmetik nicht weniger schicke Sätze der Zahlentheorie. Mathematik pur, Mathematik anschaulich, Mathematik handgemacht. Empfohlene Vorkenntnisse: Jede/r kann mitmachen, der mathematische Vorkenntnisse aus dem Gymnasium mitbringt. Und wenn Du nicht auf dem Gymnasium warst, aber gerne mitmachen möchtest: Dann trau dich! Man sollte natürlich schon mal mit Geometrie und Algebra zu tun gehabt haben. Vieles wird dann wieder aufgefrischt, denn wir machen dann nicht auf dem Niveau der 12. oder 13. Klasse weiter, sondern bauen die Teilgebiete, in denen wir arbeiten, noch einmal grundlegend auf. Oberstufenwissen zu Analysis und Linearer Algebra ist nicht notwendig! Zielgruppen: Jeder an Mathematik interessierte Mensch kann mitmachen. Außerdem werden unsere Lehramtsstudierenden an der PH Heidelberg am MOOC teilnehmen. Der Kurs richtet sich also auch an alle Studierende des Lehramts Mathematik und an alle Mathelehrerinnen und Mathelehrer. Du unterrichtest Mathematik in der Grundschule und hast niemals Mathematik studiert? Dann bist Du hier richtig! Wir werden unser gesamtes didaktisches Know-How einsetzen. In dem Kurs kannst du also nicht nur mathematisch denken lernen, sondern auch "am eigenen Leib" erfahren, wie man Mathematik lernt und lehrt. Welcher Mitmach-Typ bist Du? Du kannst dich entscheiden, wie aktiv Du dich in den Kurs einbringen möchtest - je nach Interesse und Ehrgeiz! 1) Kiebitze wollen "nur mal gucken" oder mit dem mathematischen Denken erst einmal warm werden. Kiebitze schnuppern jede Woche in den Kurs, schauen sich eins, zwei Videos an und stöbern vielleicht einmal in den weiterführenden Bereichen. Hierdurch bekommen sie einen Einblick, was mathematisches Denken bedeutet, und sie erhalten Impulse, wo man Mathematik auch im Alltag findet und gebrauchen kann. Vielleicht bekommen sie dabei sogar Lust auf mehr! Aufwand: ca. 1-2 Stunden pro Woche 2) Anpacker legen Hand an und erforschen aktiv Mathematik, haben aber keine rechte Lust auf zu viele Formeln. Für Anpacker heißt es: Ärmel hochkrempeln! Im MOOC lernen sie, wie man mathematische Situationen systematisch erforscht, wie man anschauliche Begründungen für mathematische Gesetzmäßgikeiten finden kann, und sie erhalten einen Einblick darin, wie man Abstraktes konkretisiert (und umgekehrt). Sie entwickeln ihre Vorstellungskraft zur Lösung mathematischer Probleme weiter und lernen, Vermutungen anhand konkreter Modelle zu untersuchen. Aufwand: ca. 3-4 Stunden pro Woche 3) Formalisierer geben sich mit der Anschauung nicht zufrieden - sie wollen Formeln sehen! Formalisierer sind Anpacker, die zusätzlich auch noch das Spiel mit abstrakter Symbolsprache lieben. Sie lernen, formale Definitionen zu fassen und formale Beweise zu führen. Natürlich immer basierend auf tragfähigen Vorstellungen, die sie mit den Anpackern teilen! Aufwand: ca. 7-8 Stunden pro Woche Du möchtest ein Kiebitz in der Arithmetik sein, aber ein Anpacker in der Geometrie? Oder ein Formalisierer in der Arithmetik, aber ein Kiebitz in der Geometrie? Kein Problem - alles ist möglich! So kannst Du deinen individuellen Aufwand selbst wählen und dir diejenigen Inhalte zusammenstellen, die dich interessieren. Nicht schauen, sondern machen! - Das Kursformat: Das Grundkonzept des Kurses ist nicht "schauen", sondern "machen". Wir machen Mitmach-Mathematik. Daher gibt es nicht nur Videos, sondern jede Menge interaktive Materialien zum Erforschen von Mathematik, spannende Aufgaben, die einen packen und nicht mehr loslassen, und eine Vielzahl an Möglichkeiten, sich mit anderen Menschen über ihre mathematischen Erfahrungen auszutauschen. FAQ: Was um alles in der Welt ist ein MOOC? Ein MOOC ist ein "Massive Open Online Course", ein Online-Kurs mit einer sehr großen Teilnehmerzahl. Wir haben einen von zehn MOOC-Fellowships des Stifterverbandes in Kooperation mit iversity gewonnen und starten unseren Mathe-MOOC im Oktober diesen Jahres. Also ist der MOOC so etwas wie Online-Mathe-Nachhilfe? Nein, der MOOC ist keine Mathe-Nachhilfe, kein Mathe-Schnellkurs und kein Mathe-Repetitorium. Hier gibt es keine schnellen Rezepte. Wir machen Mathematik auf eine vielleicht ungewohnte und unerwarterte Art, mit der man Schritt für Schritt zu mehr mathematischem Verständnis kommt. Du wirst es erleben - lass dich überraschen! Gibt es irgendwo ein Beispiel? Wir haben ein Beispielkapitel erstellt, anhand dessen man sich schon einmal einen Eindruck verschaffen kann: The Secret of Pythagoras ist unter http://testkapitel.mathemooc.de abrufbar. Dort kannst du dich auch schon beteiligen, eigene Lösungsideen und Lösungen posten und uns Feedback geben! Ist die Teilnahme kostenlos? Die Teilnahme am Mathe-MOOC ist kostenlos und für jeden offen. In welchem Zeitraum findet der MOOC statt? Wir beginnen am 14. April 2014, und der MOOC wird bis Mitte Februar gehen. Jede Woche werden neue Kapitel zur Verfügung gestellt, mit denen du dich innerhalb der Woche (und darüber hinaus) beschäftigen kannst. Mit einer kleinen Weihnachtspause werden das insgesamt ca. 15 Wochen sein. Bekomme ich nach dem Kurs eine Bescheinigung für die erfolgreiche Teilnahme? Ja. Lernende, die den Kurs abschließen, bekommen eine Bescheinigung für die erfolgreiche Teilnahme, signiert von den beiden Dozenten. Unter welcher Lizenz stehen die Mathe-MOOC-Videos und Materialien? Alle Materialien stellen wir unter eine freie Lizenz: Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/de/ Welche Mittel brauche ich, um teilzunehmen? Eigentlich nur das Internet und einen Webbrowser, der auch Java kann. Falls Du dir nicht sicher bist, ob Du alle Voraussetzungen erfüllst: Mach trotzdem mit. Falls technische Probleme auftauchen, werden wir eine Möglichkeit bieten, sich Hilfe zu holen. Alles andere ist "nice-to-have", aber kein Muss: ein Drucker, um sich Arbeitsmaterialien ausdrucken zu können; Schere, Karton, Stifte und Kleber, um Mathematik zu basteln; ein digitaler Fotoapparat oder ein Smartphone, um Fotos zu machen und ins Internet zu stellen; ein Twitter-, Facebook- oder Google+-Account, um dich mit anderen Lernenden auch in diesen Umgebungen zu vernetzen.

Wann sind Drogenfahnder erfolgreich? Wer wissen will, wie man bei solchen Fragen zu guten Antworten gelangt, ist bei diesem MOOC genau richtig.', 'Ganz gleich in welcher Wissenschaftsdisziplin, Statistik ist das Schweizer Armeemesser für die Behandlung von vielen Zahlen – um daraus wenige Zahlen zu machen. Das klingt unspektakulär, hat aber schon so manchen Studierenden der Human-, Wirtschafts- und Naturwissenschaften an den Rand der Verzweiflung geführt. Dabei ist Statistik überall, in den alltäglichsten Situationen und den komplexesten Forschungsfragen. In dieser Einführung kümmern wir uns um das Fundament der Statistik, die Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie. Das klingt schlimm, ist es aber nicht. Wir erfahren etwas über die männliche Sicht weiblichen Intellekts, antike Cassettenhüllen, gezinkte Würfel, Milchreis, Hochrisiko-Sportfeste und vieles mehr, das uns den Einstieg in die Welt der Wahrscheinlichkeit so leicht macht als sei die Statistik auf eine strenge Diät gegangen. Kursstruktur Der Kurs deckt ein halbes Semester Grundstudiumsstatistik für Nicht-Mathematiker ab und besteht aus sechs Lerneinheiten mit jeweils 90 Minuten Lernvideos. Diese Videos sind das zentrale Lernelement des Kurses und werden durch Anwendungsbeispiele in Microsoft Excel unterstützt. Zusätzlich kannst Du bei jedem Video Deinen Lernfortschritt über Quizfragen testen. Am Ende jeder Lerneinheit steht oft eine größere Übungsaufgabe, deren Lösung Dir per Video vermittelt wird. Lernergebnisse Am Ende des Kurses wirst Du die grundlegenden formalen Elemente der Wahrscheinlichkeit kennen. Du wirst verstanden haben, was sich Pierre Simon Laplace und Nikolaj Kolmogoroff unter dem Begriff Wahrscheinlichkeit vorgestellt haben. Du wirst mit bedingten Wahrscheinlichkeiten und dem Satz von Bayes umgehen können. Und schließlich wirst Du Dich in vielen Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen zurechtfinden wie der Binomialverteilung, der Poissonverteilung, der hypergeometrischen Verteilung und der Normalverteilung. Vorkenntnisse Alles, was Du zum Genuss der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie brauchst, lernst Du hier. Du brauchst keine besonderen Vorkenntnisse, denn mehr als Plus, Minus, Mal und Geteilt wird hier kaum gerechnet. Versprochen!

(95, 'Grundlagen des Marketing', 'Dieser Kurs vermittelt die Grundzüge des Marketing und gibt einen Überblick hinsichtlich der entsprechenden Konzepte, Strategien und Werkzeuge. Im Zentrum des Kurses stehen vier Themenbereiche: Produkt-, Kommunikations-, Preis- und Distributionspolitik.', 'Was ist Marketing? Marketing ist eine zentrale Funktion, die mit allen Unternehmensbereichen verknüpft ist. Ohne Marketing funktioniert gar nichts. Nur, wer den Kunden versteht und weiß, wie er denkt, kann auch die richtigen Produkte produzieren und verkaufen. Marketing geht jeden etwas an – ob Ingenieure (Produktpolitik), Werber & PR-Leute (Kommunikationspolitik), Controller (Preispolitik) oder Verkaufsmanager (Distributionspolitik)! Aber was ist Marketing eigentlich? Viele Laien setzen Marketing mit „Werbung“ gleich. In der Unternehmenspraxis dagegen ist Marketing (vom englischen „market“ für Markt bzw. vermarkten) eng mit der Markt- und Unternehmensstrategie verknüpft und umfasst mehrere Facetten: Zunächst versteht man heute unter dem Marketing eines Unternehmens alle marktbezogenen Aktivitäten gegenüber den (potenziellen) Kunden sowie den Aufbau und Erhalt von Kundenbeziehungen. Marketing beschränkt sich somit nicht nur auf die Bereiche Verkauf und Werbung, sondern umfasst eine Vielzahl an Aktivitäten, u.a. die systematische Informationsgewinnung über Märkte oder die Gestaltung des Produktangebots, die Preissetzung, die Kommunikation und den Vertrieb. Aus unternehmensinterner Sicht müssen außerdem die Voraussetzungen geschaffen werden, damit marktbezogene Aktivitäten effizient umgesetzt werden können. Dies wird insbesondere durch die Führung des gesamten Unternehmens nach der Leitidee der Marktorientierung erreicht. Marketing wird folglich auch als gedankliche Leitlinie für unternehmerische Entscheidungen verstanden und stellt eine zentrale betriebswirtschaftliche Funktion innerhalb eines marktorientierten Unternehmens dar. Von den Grundlagen zur Distribution Folgende Themen werden im Kurs behandelt: Marketing - Philosophie und Grundlagen Der Marketing-Management-Prozess als Rahmenwerk Das Marketing-Umfeld analysieren: Märkte, Konsumenten und Wettbewerber als Fokus der Marktforschung Marketing-Strategie: Marktsegmentierung und Wettbewerbsstrategien Produktpolitik - das Herz des Marketing Kommunikationspolitik - Marketing ist mehr als Werbung! Preispolitik - Strategien und Konzepte zur Steigerung der Unternehmensprofitabilität Distributionspolitik - Produkte und Dienstleistungen zum Kunden bringen Der Kurs beginnt am 15. Oktober 2013 und endet, unterbrochen von einer kurzen Pause über die Weihnachtsferien, am 15. Januar 2014. Lernziele Sie sind in der Lage, verschiedene Formen und Aufgaben des Marketings zu unterscheiden und relevante Marktforschungsfelder zu bestimmen. Mittels betriebswirtschaftlicher Werkzeuge können Sie Kaufentscheidungsprozesse analysieren und diese Erkenntnisse für die Produktentwicklung und für Marketing-Prozesse nutzen. Sie sind in der Lage, wichtige Marketing-Strategien zu identifizieren und zielorientiert anzuwenden. Durch die Anwendung theoretischer Modelle können Sie Produktneuentwicklungen in verschiedene Phasen unterteilen und auf diese Weise organisieren. Sie sind in der Lage, die zentralen Dimensionen des Marketings (die sog. “4 Ps” Produkt-, Preis-, Distributions- und Kommunikationspolitik) zu unterscheiden und für Marketing-Prozesse zu nutzen. Kursformat Über die Laufzeit des Kurses werden Video-Lectures angeboten, welche die Inhalte auf anschauliche Weise vermitteln. Darüber hinaus setzen viele Aspekte des Marketing Kommunikationsfähigkeit und Teamarbeit voraus. Dies wird in diesem Kurs mit Foren und Peer-Review-Aufgaben realisiert. Vorkenntnisse Für diesen Einführungskurs in das Marketing ist kein spezifisches Vorwissen notwendig. Aufgrund der systematischen Vorgehensweise und zunehmenden Vertiefung werden die Teilnehmenden in alle relevanten Inhalte eingeführt. Grundlegende Fertigkeiten im Umgang mit dem Computer sind für die Kursteilnahme von Vorteil. Zertifizierung Bei erfolgreichem Abschluss des Online-Kurses bekommen Sie ein Teilnahmezertifikat (Onlineprüfung). Wenn Sie statt der Online-Prüfung eine Präsenzprüfung erfolgreich absolvieren erhalten Sie statt des Teilnahmezertifikates eine Urkunde über das Äquivalent von 5 ECTS-Punkten der Fachhochschule Lübeck. Mittels problemlösungsorientierter Aufgaben sowie durch die Bearbeitung von Fallstudien und diversen Quizzes festigen Sie das neu erworbene Wissen und erwerben die notwendigen Kompetenzen, um es auf konkrete Herausforderungen anwenden zu können. Ein zentraler Aspekt hierbei bildet das Peer-Review.
